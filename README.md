# Optimal-job-dispatching

This was a group project in the context of Networking for data centers class in M.Sc. in Data Science @Sapienza. 
The purpose was to design a dispatching-scheduling algorithm and simulate a system such that the mean job response time would be minimized performing it on this Google datacenter workload dataset publicly available.
